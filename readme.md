## Description

### Purpose
Create a functioning website that shows insight to prospective employers about my credibility and abilities as a Web Developer. This website is a way of showing a bit of my personality while maintaining a high level of professionalism in overall aesthetic and design.

### Functionality/features
My website uses elements consistently like flexbox and responsive design in each page to give an overarching theme in design and visuals. I used black as my primary color with accents of gold and white to complement the overall aesthetic of the site. Visually it is very simplistic and provides the user with readily easy means of navigating the site.

### Sitemap
The website navigates through four different channels: the home page, about page, blogs page, and contact page. All these elements are attached to the top of the screen and can be accessed at any point. At the bottom of each screen are links to different social media platforms where I can in theory be reached. The about page features a resume that links to a pdf file of my prior work and educational experiences. The blogs page features five different blogs that link to various blog pages when engaged with.
